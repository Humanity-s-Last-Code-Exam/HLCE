## Overview

Code generation is a core capability of large language models (LLMs), yet mainstream benchmarks (e.g., APPs and LiveCodeBench) contain questions with medium-level difficulty and pose no challenge to advanced LLMs. To better reflect advanced reasoning and code generation ability, we introduce **Humanity's Last Code Exam (HLCE)**, comprising 235 of the most challenging problems from the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC World Finals) and the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) spanning 2010-2024.
